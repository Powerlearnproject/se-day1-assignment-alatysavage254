#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic approach to the develpoment, maintenance and operation of software. 
Importance of Software Engineering in the Technology Industry:
- Risk Management: There is identification and mitigation of risks early in the project lifecycle.
- Security: Cybersecurity where systems that have robust security features where there is minimal breaches and data thefts.
- Collaboration among stakeholders and non-stake holders


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- in the 60's there was a software crisis where projects would be over budgeted, late and often failed to meet user requirement, this lead to an engineering 
  approach to software development, which made software development as a formal engineering discipline.
- Rise of Object Oriented programming, there were rise of oop languages like c++, java.
  concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance and polymorphism which allowed modular, reusable and maintenable code.
  OOP revolutionized software development by promoting better organization of code.
- Agile Rise, transformed the way software is developed by promoting iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability. This approach has become widely 
  adopted

  



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - This is the phase where project goals, feasibility, scope and resoources are determined
The objective is to create a roadmap for the project.
Requirements Analysis - stakeholders gather and collect the functional and non-functional requirements
a software requirement specification(srs) document is created.
Design - This phase involves creation of user interfaces, databases and software components are designed
Tools such as UML is used
Implementation(Coding) - Developers write code on the design specifications
programming  languages and frameworks are chosen based on project needs
Testing - the software is tested for bugs, errors and vulnerabilities
unit, integration and system testing are performed
Deployment - the software is released to production environment
Maintenance and support - updates and bug fixes and performance improvements are made.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall and Agile methodologies are two distinct approaches to software development. Waterfall is a linear, sequential process where each phase of the SDLC is completed before moving to the next, making it ideal for projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements, such as regulated industries or small, fixed-scope projects. In contrast, Agile is iterative and incremental, focusing on flexibility, continuous feedback, and frequent releases. It suits dynamic environments, complex projects, and customer-centric development, such as tech startups or evolving product development. Waterfall emphasizes predictability and documentation, while Agile prioritizes adaptability and collaboration. Choosing between them depends on project stability, requirement clarity, and the need for customer involvement.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer - writes and maintain code, problem solver and collaborator. code reviews and documentation. 
Quality assurance engineer - Does the test planning, test execution, automation, bug reporting. 
Project manager - project planning, resource management, risk management and communication


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs and  VCS are crucial tools in software development, enhancing productivity, collaboration, and code quality. IDEs like Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse provide comprehensive environments for coding, debugging, and testing, offering features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and project management. VCS tools like Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial enable multiple developers to collaborate efficiently by managing code changes, maintaining history, and supporting branching and merging. Together, IDEs and VCS streamline the development process, ensuring efficient code management, improved collaboration, and high-quality, reliable software delivery.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements
Challenge: Requirements often change during the project, leading to scope creep and potential delays.

Strategy: Adopt agile methodologies to accommodate changes flexibly. Use iterative development and continuous feedback loops to ensure alignment with stakeholder needs. Clearly document and communicate any changes to all team members.

Technical Debt
Challenge: Accumulation of technical debt due to rushed development or lack of refactoring can hinder future progress.

Strategy: Prioritize code quality and maintain a balance between speed and sustainability. Regularly refactor code and allocate time for addressing technical debt in the development schedule.

Integration Issues
Challenge: Integrating different systems, modules, or third-party services can be complex and error-prone.

Strategy: Use well-defined APIs and integration standards. Conduct thorough integration testing and employ continuous integration (CI) practices to detect issues early.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing
Description: Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation. Each unit, such as a function or method, is tested to ensure it performs as expected.

Importance:

Early Bug Detection: Identifies issues at the earliest stage of development.

Simplifies Debugging: Isolates problems to specific units, making debugging easier.

Facilitates Refactoring: Ensures that changes to the code do not introduce new bugs.

Integration Testing 
 It ensures that combined parts of the application work together as intended
 Importance:

Detects Interface Issues: Identifies problems in the interaction between integrated units.

Ensures Module Compatibility: Verifies that modules communicate correctly and data flows as expected.

Improves System Reliability: Ensures that the integrated system functions cohesively.

System Testing
It involves testing the system as a whole, including functionality, performance, and security.
Importance:

Validates End-to-End Functionality: Ensures the entire system works as expected in a real-world environment.

Identifies System-Level Issues: Detects issues related to system performance, security, and usability.

Ensures Compliance: Verifies that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

 Acceptance Testing
conducted to determine whether the software is ready for delivery and meets the end-users' needs and requirements.

Importance:

User Satisfaction: Ensures the software meets user expectations and requirements.

Business Readiness: Verifies that the software is ready for deployment and use in a production environment.

Final Validation: Provides a final check to ensure all aspects of the software are functioning correctly.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the practise of designing and refining prompts to effectively guide AI models to produce desired outputs
Importance
Improves Output Quality: Well-crafted prompts lead to more accurate, relevant, and coherent responses from AI models. Poorly designed prompts can result in vague, irrelevant, or incorrect answers.
Enhances Control: Prompt engineering allows users to steer the AI's behavior, ensuring it aligns with specific goals or tasks. For example, prompts can be tailored to generate creative content, provide technical explanations, or simulate a specific tone or style.
Reduces Ambiguity: Clear and precise prompts minimize misunderstandings, enabling the AI to interpret the request correctly and deliver useful results.
Optimizes Efficiency: Effective prompts reduce the need for multiple iterations or corrections, saving time and computational resources.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about computers."
Improved Prompt:
Clear, Specific, and Concise Prompt: "Explain the key differences between RAM and ROM in computers, focusing on their functions and how they are used in modern computing.
